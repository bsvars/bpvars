# bpvars

An **R** package for Forecasting with Bayesian Panel Vector
Autoregressions

Provides Bayesian estimation and forecasting of dynamic panel data using
Bayesian Panel Vector Autoregressions with hierarchical prior
distributions. The model includes country-specific VARs that share a
global prior distribution. Under this prior expected value, each
country’s system follows a global VAR with country-invariant parameters.
Further flexibility is provided by the hierarchical prior structure that
retains the Minnesota prior interpretation for the global VAR and
features estimated prior covariance matrices, shrinkage, and persistence
levels. Bayesian forecasting is developed for models including exogenous
variables, allowing conditional forecasts given the future trajectories
of some variables and restricted forecasts assuring that rates are
forecasted to stay positive and less than 100. The package implements
the model specification, estimation, and forecasting routines,
facilitating coherent workflows and reproducibility. Beautiful plots,
informative summary functions, and extensive documentation complement
all this. An extraordinary computational speed is achieved thanks to
employing frontier econometric and numerical techniques and algorithms
written in **C++**. The **bpvars** package is aligned regarding objects,
workflows, and code structure with the **R** packages **bsvars** by
[Woźniak (2024)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bsvars) and
**bsvarSIGNs** by [Wang & Woźniak
(2024)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bsvarSIGNs), and they
constitute an integrated toolset.

## Features

#### Forecasting with Bayesian Panel Vector Autoregressions

- The model in the **bpvars** package features a country-specific Vector
  Autoregressive equation for the country-specific:
  - dependent variables `Yc`,
  - lagged dependent variables `Xc`,
  - error terms `Ec`,
  - autoregressive parameters `Ac`, and
  - error term covariance matrix `Sc`.

  ``` R
       Yc = Xc Ac + Ec         (VAR equation)
  Ec | Xc ~ MN(0, I, Sc)       (error term normality)
  ```
- The error terms feature a zero-mean matrix-variate normal distribution
  with row-specific covariance matrix `Sc` and column-specific
  covariance equal to the identity matrix of order `T`, denoted by `I`.
- The Hierarchical Panel VAR model features a sophisticated hierarchical
  prior structure that grants the model flexibility, interpretability,
  and improved forecasting performance.
- The country-specific parameters follow a prior distribution that, at
  its mean value, represents a global VAR model with a global
  autoregressive parameter matrix `A` and a global error term covariance
  matrix `S`:

``` R
       Yc = Xc A + Ec          (VAR equation)
  Ec | Xc ~ MN(0, I, S)        (error term normality)
```

  [presentation](https://bsvars.org/2025-03-bvarPANELs-ilo/)

#### Simple workflows

- Specify the models using the `specify_bvarPANEL$new()` function
- Estimate the models using the
  [`estimate()`](https://bsvars.org/bsvars/reference/estimate.html)
  method
- Predict the future using the
  [`forecast()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/forecast.html)
  method
- Compute forecast error variance decompositions using function
  [`compute_variance_decompositions()`](https://bsvars.org/bsvars/reference/compute_variance_decompositions.html)
- Use [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) and
  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) methods to gain the
  insights into the core of the empirical problem.

#### Fast and efficient computations

- Extraordinary computational speed is obtained by combining
  - the application of frontier econometric and numerical techniques,
    and
  - the algorithms written in **cpp**
- It combines the best of two worlds: the ease of data analysis with
  **R** and fast **cpp** algorithms
- The algorithms used here are very fast. But still, Bayesian estimation
  might take a little time. Look at our beautiful **progress bar** in
  the meantime:

## Start your Bayesian analysis of data

The beginnings are as easy as ABC:

``` r
library(bpvars)                                     # load the package

spec = specify_bvarPANEL$new(                           # specify the model
  ilo_dynamic_panel                                     # data
)

burn = estimate(spec, S = 10000)                        # run the burn-in
post = estimate(burn, S = 10000)                        # estimate the model

fore = forecast(                                        # forecast the model 
  post,                                                 # estimation output
  horizon = 6                                           # forecast horizon
)

plot(fore, "COL", main = "Forecasts for Colombia")
summary(fore, "COL")$variable2

post |>                                                 # estimation output
  compute_variance_decompositions(horizon = 6) |>       # compute variance decompositions
  plot(which_c = "COL")                                 # plot variance decompositions
```

The **bpvars** package supports a simplified workflow using the `|>`
pipe:

``` r
ilo_dynamic_panel |>                                    # data
  specify_bvarPANEL$new() |>                            # specify the model
  estimate(S = 10000) |>                                # run the burn-in
  estimate(S = 10000) -> post                           # estimate the model

post |> forecast(                                       # forecast the model 
  horizon = 6                                           # forecast horizon
) |> plot("COL", main = "Forecasts for Colombia")
```

Now, you’re ready to analyse your model and forecasts!
